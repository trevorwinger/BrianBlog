                                        <p><i>By Brian Daniel</i></br>
											Normally, the NFL Draft comes in the midst of one of the best stretches for sports fans all year. March Madness and the Frozen Four and The Masters would have ended earlier this month, Opening Day in the MLB would have happened, and we’d be nearly a month into the season already, and the NHL and NBA playoffs would be going full-tilt.
											And still, in a normal year, the NFL Draft, for this fan at least, would be the priority amidst all the other action. What can I say? I love me some NFL; I was thrilled when free agency opened, so at least I’d have something other than the virus to read about.
											Or course, this year is as far from normal as any in my lifetime. One would have to travel back in time to World War II to see anything even rivaling this, and even that pales in comparison to everything being cancelled or postponed in the spring of 2020. We’ll not get into that here. 
											Which is why I’m beyond thrilled that the NFL did not postpone or push back its draft. It gives sports-starved fans something to talk about, something to watch beside Marbula One marble racing or the Marbolympics. Don’t laugh. It’s a bit mesmerizing. But that’s another post for another time.
											I’m going to miss the fans booing the commissioner and the hysterics of Jets and Giants fans when it was held at Madison Square Garden, the latter of which we won’t see for quite some time since the NFL now has the draft site on the move. Of course, this year it will be strictly digital, but still, it will be fascinating.
											Since, first and foremost, I bleed purple, I’m going to hash out some of the Minnesota Vikings’ draft options, and, not that it matters one bit, what I would do if I were “Trader” Rick Spielman, their GM. I’ll finish with my quick first-round mock, since everyone else is doing it, and a few thoughts on some of the more intriguing players in the draft.
											First though, a word about the Gronk news yesterday. My Kansas City Chiefs-loving wife reminded me that I predicted he’d come out of retirement last fall when he first came on the set of the FOX pregame show in jeans and a sport coat sans tie. When news Brady signed with Tampa broke a few weeks back, I told her Gronk would join him with the Bucs. Hey, once in a while, I get something right. (She lets me know the rare occurrence.) Question is, will Gronk be effective and healthy. He seems refreshed, but he needs to put some bulk on again. All I know is there are an embarrassment of riches for Brady to throw to in TB – Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Gronk, O.J. Howard or Cam Brate (I suspect one will be traded). I also suspect they’ll draft him some offensive line help and a back, since I and every fantasy football owner knows, you can’t trust Ronald Jones III.
											OK, that small aside, let’s take a look at the Purple. Gone are WR Stefon Diggs, CBs Xavier Rhodes, Trae Waynes, Mackensie Alexander, DE Everson Griffen, and OL Josh Kline, all starters last season. Top four priorities going into the draft have to be cornerback, wide receiver, offensive line, and edge rusher/defensive line. And, could the Vikings draft a QB in the middle rounds to develop? I remain unconvinced that Kirk Cousins has what it takes to win the big one, but what do I know?
											I’ve put together a list of players most often mocked to the Vikings at their two picks (No. 22 and 25) in the first round. It includes (player grades from Scouts Inc. in parentheses):
											</br></br><b>Wide receivers</b></br>
											Justin Jefferson, LSU (91)</br>
											Brandon Aiyuk, Arizona State (90)</br>
											Tee Higgins, Clemson (88)</br>
											Denzel Mims, Baylor (85)</br>
											</br><b>Cornerbacks</b></br>
											Trevon Diggs, Alabama (86)</br>
											Jeff Gladney, TCU (85)</br>
											Jaylon Johnson, Utah (85)</br>
											A.J. Terrell, Clemson (83)</br>
											Kristian Fulton, LSU (74)</br>
										</br><b>Offensive tackle</b></br>
											Ezra Cleveland, Boise State (90)</br>
											Josh Jones, Houston (86)</br>
											Austin Jackson, USC (84)</br>
										</br><b>Defensive line</b></br>
											Javon Kinlaw, DT, South Carolina (92)</br>
											K’Lavon Chaisson, LSU (90)</br>
											Yetur Gross-Matos, Penn State (87)</br></br>
											A few observations from the list above. I highly doubt Kinlaw or Chaisson will be available, but if so, I’d be sorely tempted to take either one if they were available. Chaisson could team up with fellow LSU alum Danielle Hunter to bring heat from both edges. Also, I can’t see the Vikings drafting Trevon Diggs. I can’t believe he would even be on their board.
											Of the remaining players, because of the historic depth at WR in this draft, Aiyuk, Higgins, and Mims feel like reaches, though Jefferson is intriguing if he fell. I honestly don’t see the Vikings drafting a WR in the first round with one or more of those names likely to fall into the second round and with guys like USC’s Michael Pittman Jr., TCU’s Jalen Reagor, and Colorado’s Laviska Shenault Jr. also in play in the second.
											Fulton and Jackson also seem like reaches at their current draft spots, though Fulton does hit the marks the Vikings like athletically, and Jackson is also a great athlete and the youngest player in the draft and a good developmental prospect, perhaps left tackle of the future. But both seem likely to be available later.
											Of the rest, if the Vikings don’t trade down, and I have a really hard time seeing them trade up with as many holes as they have to fill, I’d like to see them grab Gladney and Jones or Cleveland, though Johnson is intriguing but has shoulder injury concerns.
											Ideally though, if I’m Spielman. I’m aggressively looking to trade down out of one or both of those spots and pick up extra picks and get better value for the players I like. Where they’re sitting currently, I don’t know that you find great value unless a guy like Kinlaw or Chaisson or one of the top three WRs CeeDee Lamb, Jerry Jeudy, or Henry Ruggs is miraculously available. Trading further down in the first or into the top of the second round could net the Vikes a couple of extra picks to allow them to maneuver in later rounds to grab some gems. Again, what do I know? I’m just excited for the draft to happen.</br>
										</br>Here’s my quick mock:</br>
											<b>1. BENGALS – Joe Burrow, QB, LSU</b></br>
											No-brainer for Cincy. Ohio kid goes home to rescue the franchise.</br>
											<b>2. REDSKINS – Chase Young, DE, Ohio State</b></br>
											Best defensive player in the draft. Pretty sure impact player.</br>
											<b>3. CHARGERS (Projected trade with Lions) – Tua Tagovailoa, QB Alabama</b></br>
											The Bolts swoop in and grab their QB of the future. While he comes with injury risk, they didn’t want to risk Miami scooping him up at No. 5. (My personal opinion: He will be the best QB in the draft.)</br>
											<b>4. GIANTS – Tristan Wirfs, T, Iowa</b></br>
											The G-Men wanted to trade down, but settle for a great tackle.</br>
											<b>5. BUCCANEERS (Projected trade with Dolphins) – Mekhi Becton, T, Louisville</b></br>
											With Tua gone, Miami opts out of this spot and Tampa Bay jumps at the chance to protect the G.O.A.T.</br>
											<b>6. LIONS – Isaiah Simmons, LB, Clemson</b></br>
											Coach Matt Patricia was tutored by Bill Belichick to love versatile defensive players. Simmons is a loaded weapon wherever you line him up.</br>
											<b>7. PANTHERS – Jeff Okudah, CB, Ohio State</b></br>
											Perfect scenario for Carolina, who needs a great corner.</br>
											<b>8. CARDINALS – Andrew Thomas, T, Georgia</b></br>
											Arizona needs to protect Kyler Murray if they want him to make The Leap.</br>
											<b>9. JAGUARS – Justin Herbert, QB, Oregon</b></br>
											Minshew-mania was fun while it lasted, but Herbert offers far more upside.</br>
											<b>10. BROWNS – Jedrick Wills Jr., T, Alabama</b></br>
											Cleveland thinks about moving down but addresses a major need by grabbing the fourth tackle in the top 10.</br>
											<b>11. JETS – CeeDee Lamb, WR, Oklahoma</b></br>
											Sam Darnold needs protection and weapons. With the top tackles gone, Jets shepherd Lamb into the fold.</br>
											<b>12. RAIDERS – Henry Ruggs, WR, Alabama </b></br>
											Speed kills, baby. Al Davis would be proud. Ruggs runs a 4.27, and unlike Troy Williamson, he can catch. (Cue groan from Vikes’ fans.)</br>
											<b>13. 49ERS – Derrick Brown, DT, Auburn</b></br>
											While they could very well be tempted to make it three WRs in a row, San Fran drafts the replacement for DeForrest Buckner.</br>
											<b>14. DOLPHINS – Jordan Love, QB, Utah State</b></br>
											With the consensus top three gone, Dolphins turn to Love as the answer, which in this scenario means they liked him better than Herbert anyway (as do I).</br>
											<b>15. BRONCOS – C.J. Henderson, CB, Florida</b></br>
											Denver needs another CB. Henderson could go top 10.</br>
											<b>16. FALCONS – K’Lavon Chaisson, DE, LSU</b></br>
											With the top two CBs gone, Atlanta goes to the Edge.</br>
											<b>17. COWBOYS – Trevon Diggs, CB, Alabama</b></br>
											Dallas would prefer Chaisson, but he just went.</br>
											<b>18. DOLPHINS – Ezra Cleveland, OT, Boise State</b></br>
											Miami needs lots of help.</br>
											<b>19. RAIDERS – A.J. Terrell, CB, Clemson</b></br>
											Could grab Jeudy here to run with Ruggs. Gruden has to be smarter than that, right? Mayock is for sure. Solid corner pick.</br>
											<b>20. JAGUARS – Jerry Jeudy, WR, Alabama</b></br>
											I’ve got no punchline for Jeudy sliding this far.</br>
											<b>21. EAGLES – Justin Jefferson, WR, LSU</b></br>
											Everybody knows the Eagles need a receiver. Did you see what they were running out there at the end of last year?</br>
											<b>22. RAVENS (Projected trade with Vikings) – Patrick Queen, LB, LSU</b></br>
											Baltimore has a hole in the middle where Ray Lewis once roamed. Queen’s a lot smaller, but he’s fast and very good.</br>
											<b>23. PATRIOTS – A.J. Epenesa, DE, Iowa</b></br>
											New England needs guys in the trenches. This Hawkeye shows up. I could definitely see the Pats trading down. Or up for a QB? Nah. </br>
											<b>24. SAINTS – Brandon Aiyuk, WR, Arizona State</b></br>
											Seems like forever since Drew Brees had a consistent threat opposite Michael Thomas (and Marques Colston before him).</br>
											<b>25. VIKINGS – Josh Jackson, OT, Houston</b></br>
											Rangy tackle could push Riley Reiff inside or start there himself as a rookie.</br>
											<b>26. DOLPHINS – Jonathan Taylor, RB, Wisconsin</b></br>
											Miami needs help everywhere. Taylor was amazing for the Badgers, despite some fumbling issues.</br>
											<b>27. SEAHAWKS – Yetur Gross-Matos, DE, Penn State</b></br>
											Seattle has traded out of their first-round pick eight straight seasons. They stay pat and take Jadeveon Clowney’s replacement.</br>
											<b>28. VIKINGS – Jeff Gladney, CB, TCU</b></br>
											He’s a bit undersized, but tenacious. He would be an ideal slot corner if Holton Hill can hold down an outside starting spot. Bueller?</br>
											<b>29. TITANS – Ross Blacklock, DT, TCU</b></br>
											Back-to-back Horned Frogs!</br>
											<b>30. PACKERS – Cole Kmet, TE, Notre Dame</b></br>
											I couldn’t resist. Green Bay reaches for the top TE. I’d have taken about five of the WRs left on the board before him.</br>
											<b>31. RAVENS – Tee Higgins, WR, Clemson</b></br>
											Baltimore jumps into the end of the first round to grab a big WR to put opposite Hollywood Brown for Lamar Jackson to lob to.</br>
											<b>32. CHIEFS – J.K. Dobbins, RB, Ohio State</b></br>
											One more shiny toy for Andy Reid and his offense, plus a little protection for The Franchise, Patrick Mahomes, to not have to throw so much.</br></br>
											OK. That was great fun. In this scenario, the Vikings could still go out and nab Antoine Winfield Jr. in the second round and Tyler Johnson in the sixth. Oh yeah, Pittman would be a nice get at WR in the second.</br>
											But what do I know? I keep saying that, because I don’t know much, just how to pick a decent FanDuel lineup on occasion. I expect a flurry of trades over the next three days. Maybe Trent Johnson will find a home in Tampa. Maybe the Vikings trade Anthony Harris to Cleveland. As long as they don’t get ODB in return. You think Stefon was a headache?</br>
											That’s all I’ve got. Enjoy the draft!</br></br>
